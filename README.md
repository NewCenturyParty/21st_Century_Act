## The House We Must Rebuild

Welcome. My name is Riley Dean Sampson, and this project is the foundational work of the **New Century Party**.

Let us speak of Canada not merely as a nation, but as a House. It's a vast and varied home, built by many hands across generations. Yet, any house, if its foundations are left untended and its timbers are allowed to warp, will inevitably begin to show strains. We have all heard the creaks in the floorboards and felt the drafts coming through the cracks. A house neglected is a promise deferred.

This project was born from a simple conviction: a better future is possible, and we can build it together. The **21st Century Act** is not a fanciful wishlist, but a work order for a nation. It is a blueprint for profound renewal, designed to shore up our foundations with the bedrock of **Human Dignity**, frame our home with transparent and adaptive institutions, and open the doors to justice, shared prosperity, and tangible hope for all who dwell within.

This is the summons to the shared labour of renewal that transforms a blueprint into a home.

## What Is This Project?

This repository contains the full text of the **21st Century Act (Version 0.8.3)**, a comprehensive piece of draft legislation that reimagines Canada's social contact for our modern era. It is a living document, and this repository is where it lives, breathes, and evolves.

The goal is to move this document from its current version to a collaborative **Version 1.0** with the help of Canadians from all walks of life.

## The Core Vision

The 21st Century Act is built on a series of transformative ideas designed to work together:

* **Human Dignity as Law:** Establishes the inherent dignity and right to flourish of every person as the bedrock principle of all Canadian law and governance.
* **Codeshare Civics:** Reimagines democracy by treating legislation as a shared, open-source codebase on `git.canada.ca`, inviting all citizens to propose, discuss, and contribute to the laws that govern them.
* **The Dignity Dividend:** Implements a negative income tax to ensure a foundational economic floor for all Canadians, making poverty a thing of the past.
* **A Human Capital Engine:** Creates the Canadian Century Corps, a national service program that empowers citizens to gain skills and education while rebuilding the nation's social and physical infrastructure.
* **True Digital Sovereignty:** Builds a public digital commons—including new social networks, email, and a web browser—owned by Canadians and designed for civic engagement, not corporate profit.


## A Note On The Use of Artificial Intelligence

**Transparency is a core principle of this project, and that begins here.**

I could not have written this Act without the use Artificial Intelligence. I think that weakens the moral clarity and backbone of the entire thing, but it's the truth. I am not a strong enough writer, scholar, or legal expert to have done this on my own. However, I think the ideas are deeply human and worth more than throwing the whole thing aside. That said if you decide to leave now because of AI, I understand and I wish you no ill will. If you are still interested or curious, I want to explain the process I used so you can judge for yourself.

I thought this would be a story. Something I would write one day. I would chat with various AIs about a 21st Century Act, and what that might look like, and how the nation might react. It was a fun storytelling exercise. From those stories a summary formed of an unwritten act. I would keep working on this story, coming up with new ideas as I went, some of which came directly from the AI which was exciting. That summary grew larger and eventually I thought, why not get the AI to make it into the real Act instead of the summary of one.

Going to work on bringing the summary of the Act into a real thing took some time, but eventually we got to v0.1. From there I would use the Act to tell the story further, allowing the storytelling process to evolve the Act even further. This version of the Act was pretty much entirely written by AI and would be for some time. Eventually we got to a v0.7, the most comprehensive version yet. And it sucked. It was poorly written and, more importantly, it distinctly had no soul. I decided then that I had to write it from then on.

v0.8.0 was hand typed by me, copying the working of v0.7 while adding my own words, my own flow, my own voice. A human voice. It took a long time to rewrite the thing but I got it done after many late nights and weekends. At this point the role with AI reversed. Instead of me guiding and directing the AI on what to write, the AI would help me write, giving me direction and help where needed, be it where I typed out word for word what it suggested or took the essence and made it my own.

Now, months later, I have v0.8.3 completed and I can't shake the ideas. I think they are too good to be contained just in a story. The Act could not have been written without AI, but neither could AI have done this on its own. It is a strange intertwined collaboration.

That said the Act is still woefully underdeveloped. I've just reached the limit of my capabilities, even with AI help, and now I am asking for your help.
