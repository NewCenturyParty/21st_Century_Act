### Section 132: Guarantee of Social Security

(1) It is hereby affirmed that every individual in Canada has the right to Social Security, ensuring that everyone can live a dignified life, no matter their life circumstance, acknowledging that Canadians individual circumstances may require greater support than the Dignity Dividend alone.

### Section 133: Fulfilling the Right to Social Security

    (a) Ensuring the Dignity Dividend is a Tax-Free payment;

    (b) Ensuring that nothing in this Act or future legislation, including the Dignity Dividend shall be used to replace, reduce, or diminish any benefit provided by the Old Age Security Act, the Canadian Pension Plan Act, or any federal disability support program; and

    (c) For greater certainty, and notwithstanding any other Act, any payment received by an individual under the Dignity Dividend Program, or the Child Dignity Dividend, shall not be included or assessed as income or an asset by any provincial, territorial, or federal government or agency for the purposes of determining eligibility for any other benefit or service.

## Title XVIII: The Rights of the Child

### Section 134: Guarantee of the Rights of Children

(1) The Government of Canada recognizes children, as in individuals younger than 18 years of age, as a distinct marginalized minority group in need of rights, protections, and entitlements to the conditions of flourishing.

### Section 135: Fulfilling the Rights of the Child

(1) The rights of children shall be fulfilled by the Government of Canada in ways such as, but not limited to, the following:

    (a) Officially recognizing children as an oppressed class;

    (b) Requirements to fulfil the same rights as explicitly mentioned within this Part, and the entirety of Part III, ensuring that children are in mind for each right, and that implementation considers how to ensure children are guaranteed the same right;

    (c) In addition to all the rights and entitlements to the conditions of flourishing granted in this Part and Part III, children shall specifically have additional rights such as, but not limited to, the following:

        (i) The Right to be Heard and Speak Freely:

            (1) Children have the right to speak for themselves and express their views freely in all matters that affect them, and for such views to be given due weight and consideration.

            (2) The Right to be Heard and Speak Freely shall also protect children from undue influence on their speech or opinion.

        (ii) The Right to Play and Leisure:

            (1) Children must be given more than sufficient time to play, explore, rest and have time for their own leisure.

            (2) The Right to Play and Leisure shall include the right to play outdoors, with spaces designed for children with safety and play in mind as required by this section.

        (iii) The Right to Protection from Harm:

            (1) Children have the right to be shielded from all real forms of physical or mental violence, injury, neglect, or exploitation.

            (2) The Right to Protection from Harm shall not be construed as to enable censorship of any kind on difficult subjects, including sexual education, from children, who, as this Part grants, have a right to knowledge and education through the Right to Lifelong Learning and Literacy.

            (3) The Right to Protection from Harm explicitly grants protection from exploitation, which includes exploitation of body, labour, and mind.

            (4) The Right to Protection from Harm, includes protection from labour exploitation, which explicitly includes the rights of children in entertainment industries who shall not have their right to education, rest, play or dignity violated in any way.

    (d) The paramount consideration for all implementation for the rights of children shall be the best interests of the child, and all work of Parliament that involves children must first consider what is in the best interests of the child.

## Title XIX: Enforcement and Remedies

### Section 136: Application of Remedies

(1) The rights and protections affirmed and granted in this Part are legally enforceable.

(2) A person who alleges that a right conferred by this Part or Part III has been infringed may apply for a court of competent jurisdiction for:

    (a) A declaration of right;

    (b) An order in the nature of mandamus, prohibition, or other just and appropriate remedy, including a structural order with timelines where necessary to secure compliance. Monetary penalties under Title V of Part XVII of this Act do not apply to infringements of this Part unless expressly provided; and

    (c) In granting relief, the court shall respect budgetary choices except to the extent necessary to remedy the infringement.

### Section 137: Right of Action and Remedies

(1) A person directly affected by an alleged breach of any statutory entitlement created by this Act or its regulations, or any minimum standard prescribed under this Act, may bring a civil proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction for appropriate relief.

(2) A person or organization may commence a proceeding in the public interest where:

    (a) there is serious justiciable issue;

    (b) The claimant has a genuine interest; and

    (c) The proceeding is a reasonable and effective means to bring the issue before the court.

(3) The standard of review shall be thus:

    (a) For statutory entitlements (e.g., eligibility and payment of the Dignity Dividend): the issue is compliance; and

    (b) For programmatic obligations (e.g., taking reasonable measures to progressively realize access/coverage targets): the issue is reasonableness having regard to available resources, equality, non-discrimination, and non-regression.

(4) Regulations made by the Governor in Council, may define minimum core standards for each right or program; failure to meet minimum core obligations without compelling justification is presumptively unreasonable.

(5) The court may grant declaratory relief, mandamus, prohibitions, and structural orders, including timelines, reporting, and supervisory jurisdiction. Monetary damages are limited to amounts wrongfully withheld under a statutory entitlement and costs.

(6) Once a claimant shows a prima facie breach, the onus shifts to the responding authority to show reasonableness and resource justification.

(7) Applications respecting ongoing income or health-and-safety entitlements must be heard on an expedited based; interim relief may be ordered to prevent irreparable harm.

(8) This section is in addition to any right to seek judicial review or a Charter remedy.

(9) This Part shall be interpreted consistently with sections of the Constitution Act, 1982, and does not abrogate or derogate from Indigenous, Aboriginal, or Treaty Rights.
