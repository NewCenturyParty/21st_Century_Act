# Part XII: Codeshare Civics

Democracy as a shared codebase.

## Title I: Purpose and Principles of Collaborative Governance

### Section 320: Dignity in Democratic Participation

(1) The Government of Canada is committed to enacting the right to democratic access and expression, as detailed under Part IV, Title XII, and the right to a non-corrupt government, as detailed under Part IV, Title XVI of this Act, and shall do so in accordance with the principles of this Act, as detailed in section 6, and Human Dignity as detailed under Part III of this Act.

(2) In fulfilling its commitments detailed in subsection (1), the Government of Canada shall enact Codeshare Civics, a method of collaborative and participatory governance made for the 21st Century, allowing individuals in Canada to see legislation in real-time, and even suggest changes or new laws entirely, shaping the laws they themselves follow, giving dignity to legislation.

(3) Let it be acknowledged that backroom deals, lobbyist interests, and lack of transparency pose a risk to the social fabric of Canadian society, dismantling trust in the system meant to protect and provide for Canadians.

(4) The Government of Canada chooses action in the face of such challenges, and shall take such actions through the lens of Human Dignity, and the foundational principles of this Act, ensuring that all individuals in Canada have a say in the laws that govern them.

## Title II: Overview and Core Principles

### Section 321: Reimagining Public Legislation

(1) Codeshare Civics is hereby established as a foundational approach to public participation in Canadian governance, reimagining civic engagement in the legislative process as iterative, transparent, and collective in authorship.

(2) This approach affirms that democracy is a shared codebase with governance that must be open-source, where every citizen is invited to be a contributor.

### Section 322: Core Principles

(1) Codeshare Civics shall operate on the following core principles:

    (a) Transparency as default, which means all legislative and policy development processes, including drafting, amendments, and budgeting, shall be transparent and publicly logged in real-time;

    (b) Collaboration over consultation, which means citizens shall not merely respond to proposals they hear about through separate channels, but shall be empowered to actively participate and propose, iterate, and contribute to policy development through git.canada.ca, as detailed under Part XI of this Act, using Canadians' @canadapost.ca emails to create accounts online to contribute;

    (c) Accountability through version history, which means no change to legislation, policy, or public data shall be lost, hidden, or undocumented, ensuring a complete and accessible audit trail;

    (d) Diff view by default, which means that Diff View, as defined under section 3 of this Act, shall be implemented by default for all works on git.canada.ca, ensuring that any changes made can be easily seen through visual markers; and

    (e) Public interest commits, which means every legislative action shall be accompanied by a clear changelog, rationale, and mechanism for public and Parliamentary feedback and review.

## Title III: Legal Integration and Parliamentary Procedure

### Section 323: Integration of git.canada.ca and Parliament

(1) The digital civic platform, git.canada.ca, as established under Part XI of this Act, shall serve as the central repository for all federal legislation, regulation, policies, and publicly funded research.

(2) All items tabled in the Parliament of Canada shall be required to be mirrored exactly, or originate from, git.canada.ca.

(3) Any changes or amendments to proposed legislation during the parliamentary process shall be accompanied by plain-language commit summaries on git.canada.ca, explaining the rationale behind the change, no matter how small.

(4) Commit authors, or stewards, including Members of Parliament, and public servants, shall be required to include Dignity Impact Assessments for their proposed changes before legislation proceeds to the final vote.

(5) Popular legislative proposals, found online through platforms like Aurora, or offline through signed petitions, can be brought to Parliament by Members of Parliament who wish to sponsor said proposals. Such proposals shall be mirrored, if not already, to git.canada.ca where those proposing the changes shall be all labeled as contributing stewards, with proper accreditation and compensation, including monetary.

(6) Aurora Circles shall be set up to directly discuss and contribute to legislation found on git.canada.ca.

(7) Audit trails generated by git.canada.ca shall be legally admissible and subject to oversight by Parliament, and Democracy Watch Canada.

## Title IV: Civic Engagement and Education

### Section 324: Codeshare Civics Education

(1) Codeshare Civics education shall be a part of the new K-12 curricula made in partnership with the provinces and territories, as detailed under Part VIII of this Act, ensuring that children will know how to participate in their governance as they come of age, with particular focus given to ensuring by voting age individuals are comfortable and capable of navigating and making proposals on git.canada.ca.

(2) Codeshare Civics shall be taught to new Canadian Century Corps Cadets, ensuring those who serve their country have a say in how it operates.

(3) All education material on Codeshare Civics must include hands-on practice, in education-specific forks or branches of the main git.canada.ca, and its various items, as to ensure individuals in Canada are comfortable with the actual use and practice of Codeshare Civics.

### Section 325: Public Engagement

(1) Dignity Hubs, as established in Part III of this Act, and participating Libraries Canada libraries, as detailed in Part VIII of this Act, shall run weekly workshops, ‘Patching the Law’ which shall provide citizens with hands-on opportunities to engage with legislative drafting, amendments, and making forks or pull requests, all on git.canada.ca.

(2) The Canadian Century Corps’ Digital and Tech Corps’ Cadets shall host regional periodic Civic Hackathons to encourage collaborative problem-solving and the development of innovative solutions to public policy challenges using open-source tools.

## Title V: Safeguards and Platform Integrity

### Section 326: Verification and Security for Codeshare Civics

(1) All educational or public engagement use of git.canada.ca shall be on separate branches that do not affect the main works found in git.canada.ca, as such power is reserved exclusively for Members of Parliament, or eligible public servants described by regulations.

(2) In order to participate in Codeshare Civics using git.canada.ca, individuals must create an account using their @canadapost.ca email address domains, which requires in-person, human, authentication, ensuring accountability. For clarity, git.canada.ca shall remain read-only without an account, which allows all individuals to clearly and easily see the laws and works that govern them.

(3) Harmful content, abuse, or attempts at misinformation or disinformation on git.canada.ca shall trigger rapid ethical triage by the Canada Digital Public Square Corporation.

(4) Democracy Watch Canada shall have the ability to oversee and recommend changes to git.canada.ca through partnership with the Canada Digital Public Square Corporation.

### Section 327: Diff View Democracy

(1) A Diff View feature, as defined under section 3 of this Act, is hereby mandated for integration across Canada’s legislative infrastructure, including and in particular git.canada.ca.

(2) This Diff View feature shall allow anyone to clearly see the differences between drafts, legislative versions, and institutional changes over time, shown with authorship and metadata such as time and date, ensuring that governance is legible, accountable, iterative, and trackable.

(3) Diff View will clearly show the changes through symbolic and colour-coded means, such as ‘--’ for removals with red highlighting, and ‘++’ for additions with green highlighting, in a side-by-side manner, ensuring easy understanding of the changes made or proposed.

(4) Every proposed law, amendment, regulation, policy, or any legislation submitted to git.canada.ca repositories shall be subject to Diff View.
