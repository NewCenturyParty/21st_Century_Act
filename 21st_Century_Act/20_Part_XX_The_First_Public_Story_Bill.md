# Part XX: The First Public Story Bill

Stories are how we understand our world, and so shall it be used to understand legislation.

## Title I: Purpose and Principles of Storytelling

### Section 445: Dignity in Narrative Explanation

(1) Let it be acknowledged what is already known to Indigenous cultures around the world, that learning is best done through storytelling, and that if you want to explain something you need to make it relevant and understandable in our contextual world, and our own place within.

(2) As prescribed in Part VII of this Act, every Act enacted after the coming into force of this 21st Century Act, must include a Public Story Bill, a narrative explainer in plain language on the context of this Act and its provisions.

(3) Public Story Bills are for illustrative and educational purposes only and are not legally binding in any way. The reader must consult the previous Parts of this Act, using the Table of Contents to find the specific provision that is legally binding.

### Section 446: Legal Clarity

(1) It is hereby affirmed that this Part of this Act is enacted for illustrative and educational purposes only.

(2) This Part of this Act has no legal force or effect and creates no rights, duties, powers, immunities, liabilities, offences, penalties, entitlements, causes of action, or procedural rights.

(3) For greater certainty, nothing in this Part shall be used to resolve any ambiguity in, or to limit or extend the meaning of, any other provision of this Act, or any other enactment.

(4) No proceeding may be commenced or maintained, and no remedy or relief may be granted or refused, by reason only of anything contained in this Part.

(5) No regulation may be made under this Part.

(6) The Minister may cause illustrative materials and public-facing explanations to be published from time to time. Such materials do not form part of this Act and have no legal force or effect.

## Title II: Human Dignity

### Section 447: The Dignity Dividend

 The whole thing didn’t feel real. From the beginning the promise of money FROM the government not TO the government, if you make under $100,000? Amy isn’t sure she’s ever even spoken to someone who makes that much money. So, when all the election hullabaloo finished and whatever bills passed, she heard on the news that the first Dignity Dividend was coming July 1, so soon she could hardly believe it. Now here she was, at the local park celebrating Canada Day, when a bank notification hits her phone. DEPOSIT: CAN DIG DIV $734.82 \+

 ‘Oh my god,’ she said, almost involuntarily, ‘It’s real\!’

 ‘What’s real?’ asked Sarah.

 ‘Nothing hunny,’ Amy responds, giving her daughter a kiss on her head. She grabs Sarah’s hand and they walk over to the little farmer’s market the park set up for the event. After some looking, she finds fresh strawberries, and buys two baskets, one of both of them this time. Normally she couldn’t even afford the one, but today? Well, today might be the start of something new.

## Title III: Digital Sovereignty

### Section 448: The Viral Post

 Vanessa was an artist at heart, and her studio apartment showed it. Paint was everywhere, not always on the canvas strewn about the small room. It was a mess, but it was hers. It’s where she felt most alive, but that doesn’t pay the bills, which have been piling. Literally, as Vanessa is not the digital type, so she gets all her bills physically. It fits her artistic style she claims. Her paintings were thick, brushstrokes creating dunes of paint in ways abstract, and beautiful. It was all she thought about, how to give paintings physicality and humanity. It’s what set her apart, at least in Carlos’ eyes. He was the one who suggested the whole Aurora thing.

 Carlos was as online as one could be, and thus was first in line at the local Post Office when the time came to get a Digital Social Insurance Number, which came with a cool shiny metal card that had a QR code laser-engraved. Scanning that card allowed him to set up an @canadapost.ca email address, <carlos99@canadapost.ca> naturally, which could then further be used to make an Aurora account. The process took a while, and wasn’t as quick or convenient as other online account making, with all the security and human verification, but Carlos didn’t mind. He wanted to try the new thing, see the digital frontier, and that frontier was full of northern lights and Reaction Stamps.

 Aurora is an online federated social media forum platform that is like reddit meets twitter meets mastodon. That is to say, it’s a link aggregate. You post stuff on there, taken from places around the internet, as well as Original Content, which people uprank or downrank, or award Reaction Stamps. Those stamps are little tokens of appreciation or recognition, that not only show up on posts, visibly displaying community reaction, but also are then transferred to the poster’s Digital Stamp Wallet, associated with their DSIN. Those stamps have a monetary value, almost always $0.01 CAD (unless someone gave you a rare special one from the auction) and while that may not seem like much, viral posts can earn quite a bit of them.

 Explaining all this to Vanessa was a process in itself, but after weeks of begging he finally got a concession. Carlos will take a picture of Vanessa with her Art, and share it on Aurora’s Painting Circle, which is the dedicated Painting forum on, enclosed in the Arts Circle on Aurora, with a quote from Vanessa about the piece and her process under the picture, all on Carlos’s account xxpoisonsniperxx.

 After writing a little blurb on the piece in the photo Carlos posted it with the caption ‘Meet my Friend Vanessa, her Art rocks’ which Vanessa did not approve.

 She was excited though. The thought of people seeing her art and maybe even appreciating it was new. If she was honest with herself, she assumed that Art, while the most important thing in her life, won’t exactly fund her life.

 Soon the upranking started, and then the first stamp, a shouting 🗣️ emoji Reaction Stamp, hit Carlos’s stamp wallet. Someone seems to approve of Vanessa’s thoughts on the physicality of art and painting. One after the other, more Reaction Stamps poured in and soon their post was the top of Aurora’s Painting Circle. After one day they had already received over 5000 Reaction Stamps. Vanessa was thrilled. People were recognizing her art and willing to pay for it\! Even if it was just one cent, it added up now to a real amount of $50, which was more than she had ever gotten for her art before. That’s when Vanessa decided maybe she will get her own DSIN and start posting on Aurora. Maybe she can start paying off all those bills.

## Title IV: Domestic Sovereignty

### Section 449: The Republic

 It never really made sense to Andrew until he had his own kid, a decade after the fact. The Republic of Canada is virtually no different than the Constitutional Monarchy he grew up in, only without the history. They still had MPs, more now than ever mind you with this whole Circular Representation thing with the ranked local and regional candidates. Sure, yes there were new things like 21st Century Neighbourhoods and Century Homes, better infrastructure, less poverty, and the list goes on, but all that change could’ve been done by the same system. It felt like stomping on traditions to Andrew, but came along little Mark and that toonie.

 Andrew collected coins since he was a little boy, always finding the little variations intriguing and fun. One day not long after his son had turned four years old, he showed Mark some of his collection, hoping to maybe pass on the tradition.

 ‘Look at this one\! Be gentle with it okay? It can rip easily,’ Andrew said handing Mark an old toonie.

 ‘Who’s that?’ Mark asked, pointing at Queen Elizabeth II.

 ‘That’s the Queen,’ Andrew replied

 ‘Why?’ asked Mark.

 ‘Because she’s ‘ well she used to be the Queen of Canada.’

 ‘Why?’

 ‘That’s a long story.’

 ‘But why is she on your money?’

 ‘Because I told you, she used to be Queen.’

 ‘But you told me we don’t have a queen.’

 ‘I know, buddy, but we used to.’

 ‘Why?’

 ‘Well because the people that came over here had a Queen and well, I guess they just brought her along.’

 ‘But, then what about the Queen of Canada that was already here?’

 ‘Well, they didn’t have a queen here before.’

 ‘Why?’

 ‘I don’t know. Maybe they didn’t need one.’

 ‘Is that why we don’t have a Queen now?’

 ‘No, bud, that’s why we have Future Stewards now, instead of a Queen’

 ‘Why?’

 ‘I don’t know bud, why don’t we go look it up?’

 Andrew and Mark spend the rest of the evening trying to answer every ‘why’ Mark had to ask, and Andrew learned about the Future Stewards in the process, the new head of the republic of Canada, the Council of Youth and Elders, and decided they sounded cooler than a Queen anyways. Canadian born and made just like him and Mark.

## Title V: Economic Democracy

### Section 450: The New Worker-Owners

 Isaiah had been working at this bakery for nearly fifteen years and wouldn’t trade it for the world. He loved almost everything about it, the chatter, the smell of coffee, and the unique little world that was created every time you stepped into the shop. What he did not love was his boss, Trevor. The owner who was old and grumpy, but damn could he make a cup of coffee, not to mention run a business off it. But after fifteen years Isaiah knew how to do most of everything around here, and the rest of the staff, like Julie, Margaret, and Sean, were like his family. They looked out for each other, which is why it hurt so much when they got the news.

 On a Friday night, as soon as the shop closed for the evening, Trevor gathered everyone around the counter for a team meeting. It was their worst nightmare. He was selling, having finally gotten a little too old and a little too grumpy, so he decided he was done. The new buyer would take control Monday, and would be tearing the place down to build a high-rise. The team was silent. Trevor continued by saying that he needed everyone to leave their aprons and keys if they had any in the back, and that any personal belongings should be taken home now otherwise they’ll be sold off with everything else. After that Trevor said goodnight and left like nothing had happened.

 ‘He can’t just do that can he?’ Julie asked, voice already choking up.

 ‘I mean it’s his business, Jules. What are we supposed to do?’ Sean said.

 ‘It’s just so, so sudden\!’ Margaret exclaimed.

 ‘No kidding,’ said Isaiah, stunned that after working here so long he didn’t get more heads up than a weekend, not even. It didn’t sit right with him. Sitting dejected with everyone else, Isaiah pulls out his phone and starts to search up what to do when your boss sells the business. The first result was sponsored but specific ‘Know your rights as a worker-owner’ with a link to the National Co-operative Development Agency’s website. He didn’t know what that meant exactly, a worker-owner, but he clicked on it anyways.

 The website was standard government affair, bland but legible, and it hosted an article on what to do when your employer sells a business. How the employees have the right to first refusal of the business if they can produce a viable business and capital plan, which then linked to funding options from the NCDA and Century Bank. ‘Well, I know how to run the place myself at this point’ thought Isaiah.

 ‘Guys do you want to be worker-owners with me?’ Isaiah asked, to an eager and curious work family.

 The transition took time, and a lot of paper work and business lessons provided by the NCDA, so the café was closed for a few weeks. However, after finalizing agreements with the Century Bank and the suppliers for the café they were able to officially reopen within the month, proudly displaying a sign saying UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT.

## Title VI: Reconciliation

### Section 451: Co-Development

 Paul had been a government lawyer for nearly 50 years, most of his life, and this was unlike anything he’d done before. First of all, he is sitting cross legged, in his nice suit mind you, in a circle of other fully grown adults in a board room inside of Parliament, that smelled like sweetgrass after the smudging. That said, he was fascinated. This was the first Sharing Circle of the Land Back discussions between Canada and several Indigenous Nations. He knew he was part of history now, even if his legs were showing. The circle was as large as the room could fit, almost half of which were just the translators.

 The Act was very clear. Any Land Back discussion to take place were to have translators for every relevant language. This meant the room had translators for five Indigenous Languages, as well as English and French, plus back-ups. Paul didn’t speak anything but plain English, and he felt a little out of his element. He wondered how it must have been like during those first land transfer talks hundreds of years ago. Soon enough it is Paul’s turn.

 ‘Hi, I’m Paul, I work for the Crown as a lawyer,’ Paul said. ‘I, uh, don’t have much else to say about myself really. I just look forward to working with everyone here to settle past wrongs’ he finished, quickly passing the stick to his right. The translators did not spend long passing the message.

 ‘Hey\! My name is Raine, I am seventeen years old, and I don’t really have a job or anything, but I do well in school and all that. One of my favourite subjects is history. And one of my great, great, great grandmothers was part of the original treaty negotiations in Saskatchewan, so I’m really excited to be here\! It, it really feels like a great honour,’ said the girl beside Paul. Raine passes the stick to her right, continuing the Sharing Circle.

 This was just one of the many Sharing Circles, and negotiations to come out of this process. It was slow, and sometimes tedious to those on the outside, but anyone who actually took part of the process knew how important it was. Even Paul eventually really came into his own, sharing more about his life, what he thinks of Canada and what it could be, and everyone else sharing the same. It felt healing. Sure, there was going to be hard conversations, especially urban land back talks, but in the circle, anything can be talked about, and anything can be accomplished.

## Title VII: The Human Capital Engine

### Section 452: The Nurse

 When Ella Singh first arrived at the Sunny Oaks Personal Care Home Ltd. as part of her training and employment with the Canadian Century Corps’ Care and Community Cadets, one thing immediately became clear: neglect. The floors were filthy, the air musty, the food questionable, and the residents miserable. ‘Oh boy’ she said to herself under her breath as the operator gave her the tour.

 Ella cried twice before lunch. There is just so much to do, so many people to care for, without enough people to help. In fact, she was supposed to be that help\! The staff were nice but clearly very burnt out. It was becoming hazardous for the residents at this point and something needed to be done. Thankfully Ella was trained for this.

 Calling her CCC team lead was easy, and Don was the best. He was the kind of guy who got it. He actually cared about people, how they were doing, what they needed, and how he could help them. Don answered right away.

 ‘Ella\! How are you, sweetheart?’ Don’s wide smile clear through his voice.

 ‘Hi, Don. I’m hiding in a supply closet’ Ella says, trying to match his happy tone through the tears.

 ‘Well, that doesn’t sound good. Are you alright? Are they treating you, okay?’ Don asks.

 ‘Yeah, no, I’m okay, everyone here is so sweet but it’s bad. Like, really bad, Don. We need more help.’ Ella replies, trying to steady her voice.

 ‘Makeover bad?’ Don asks.

 ‘Yeah,’ Ella breathes out. She knows that means a lot of disruption. They taught her about the makeover for care homes in bootcamp, but she never thought she’d have to do that. Especially on her first day.

 ‘It’s okay Ella, I’m glad you called. I’ll get some more Care Cadets out there right now, and I’ll call the province to let them know, get them to approve the makeover,’

 ‘Thanks, Don,’ Ella says with her first smile of the day.

 ‘Of course, sweetheart. Sit tight.’ Don says.

 The three additional CCC Care and Community Cadets meet Ella at the front entrance of Sunny Oaks. They introduced themselves as Tom, Mary, and Sasha, each with nursing degrees, ready to help out immediately. They ask Ella all sorts of questions, like how many residents there are, how many staff, last time people were fed and with what, where the laundry was, and more. Ella was a little taken aback by how ready and eager they were, but so grateful for it too. She answered as many questions as she could and then showed them around the facility. Everyone agreed to work overtime tonight to help with the makeover, making this a double shift of an additional six hours. Ella wasn’t daunted though.

 The new Cadets energized Ella and she was right back into the fray ready to do what she signed up for: help people. She, along with Sasha, went door to door to just talk to the residents, see how they were and if they needed anything right away. That took a few hours, but was well worth it to see the smiles and feel warmth of the residents for the first time in a long time. Meanwhile Mary and Tom were in the kitchen cooking up all sorts of fresh soups and sandwiches, after going out to buy much needed groceries.

 The regular staff watched and nodded, answering questions as they came, but mostly went about their routines, rushing to help more people than a single person was capable of. They felt unsure about this all, and too tired to really do anything about it while also doing everything else around here. Then again if these CCC kids could help, one of the older staff thought, well they weren’t in a place to say no.

 During supper, instead of everyone eating in their own rooms, they came together in the dining hall. There was actual laughter and chatter all around the hall. The staff couldn’t believe their eyes. That’s when Ella gets the call.

 ‘Hey Don\!’ Ella says, mood the total opposite of the call before.

 ‘Hey Ella\!’ Don says, matching the jubilance. ‘I got great news\! The province has agreed with work with the feds and the CCC for a total makeover\! They’ll be sending in Century Infrastructure Corps’ Cadets within the week\!’

 ‘That’s great Don\! Thank you\!’ Ella says, barely able to contain her excitement. After making sure Ella was feeling better now, Don ends the call. Ella gets up from her table, and walks to the staff, still watching in amazement at the drastically different scene in the dining room. ‘Hey guys\!’

 ‘Hi, Ella. Wow, I can’t believe what I’m seeing.’ Says Shannon, the on-site nurse.

 ‘I know right\! It’s wild what some good soup can do\!’ Ella laughs. ‘Anyway, I just wanted to let you know you guys have been approved for a makeover\! They’re going to come in and fix the place up real nice. Make it all up to Century Code. And they’ll bring in even more staff to help out\! You guys could even take a vacation if you wanted\!’

 The words seemed to wash over the tired staff. Vacation? Did she say vacation? Shannon is the first to move, with tears in her eyes she hugs Ella. Then so does Shirley, and Tammy, and all the others. It’s going to be alright. Finally, things might be alright.

## Title VIII: Codeshare Civics

### Section 453: The Typo

 It was so small, so unimportant, but yet there it was, but Taylor couldn’t ignore it. It was there\! Right there\! How did they miss it? After all the back and forth, the fighting, the faux outrage online, they finally did it, the Act was passed into law, and thus hosted on git.canada.ca, but they couldn’t run a damn spell check before pushing to main? ‘Teh right to Human Dignity’ It was almost insulting. So, Taylor did what any good citizen would do. They logged in to their git.canada.ca account using their @canadapost.ca email address and they made a fork, basically a copy, of the Act into their own computer, fixed the typo, then made a pull request for the Parliament to merge to main, basically asking to make this change permanent in law. Idiots, Taylor thought, and closed their laptop for the night. It was 12:51 AM.

 At 12:55 AM panic rushed through the halls of power in Canada. First just the overnight staff, making sure pull requests were logged and filed. Most people were trying to modify the recently passed Act to include something silly like the right to cats. This was different though. The Canada Digital Public Square employee read the commit message out loud, and the whole room stopped to listen.

 fix(part-iii): correct ‘Teh’ \--\> ‘The’ in clause four.

 \- Teh right to Human Dignity’

 \+ The right to Human Dignity’

 // TODO: add spellcheck to next build

 At 1:00 AM the PR was escalated for full review.

 At 2:00 AM the night supervisor started a comprehensive report for the Minister

 At 5:00 AM the Minister for Digital Sovereignty was informed and read the report.

 At 6:00 AM the Prime Minister was informed.

 At 7:00 AM the Cabinet is convened to discuss.

 At 9:00 AM the Parliament is informed.

 At 2:00 PM the amendment legislation is drafted, fully spell checked this time.

 At 3:00 PM the amendment passes first reading.

 At 4:00 PM the amendment passes second reading.

 At 5:00 PM the amendment passes third reading and the amendment is passed by the house.

 The next day the same process happens in the Senate, and a day later, the amendments receive Royal assent, and is published to git.canada.ca. It’s one of the fastest amendments ever made in Canadian history. The media says it was because Parliament was embarrassed, but either way Taylor didn’t care.

 They received a letter in the mail with a cheque, compensation for participation in the legislative process, and a formal letter of recognition from the Prime Minister, earnestly thanking Taylor for their contribution to Canadian Democracy. Even the stewards file on the Act’s repository on git.canada.ca, now shows Taylor’s account as an author of this Act, making them the youngest to ever author an Act like this. It felt good, and Taylor was suddenly way more interested in the whole Codeshare Civics thing the government was trying, because for her at least, it worked.

## Title IX: Ecological Stewardship

### Section 454: The Fire Spotter

 On screen the silent billowing of white and black smoke pours from an isolated spot of the emerald green Alberta Rockies. The footage was taken from a satellite video feed from the Canadian Space Agencies’ Sovereign Satellite Constellation.

 ‘That’s definitely smoke, and it’s been growing’ Nicole said, staring at her monitor, rewinding the past few hours of footage back and forth. Her team gathered around her.

 ‘And where there’s smoke’ Ian started.

 ‘Shut up. Let’s call this in,’ Nicole interrupted playfully. It was the start of fire season, and the goal was to ensure the skies weren’t choked because of out-of-control wildfires. Here at the CSA their role in this goal was to monitor for any signs of wildfires, and report them as soon as possible for containment. She sends out a video copy of the satellite video of the burgeoning wildfire to her supervisor. A job well done, but unfinished. There was a whole season left for things to get out of control.

 A few hours later a water bomber was sent to douse the flames, while Canadian Century Corps Environmental Conservation Cadets were sent in to quell any remaining flames, and clean up the surrounding forest area to ensure there was less flammable material laying around.

 Just like that a potential out of control wildfire was taken out. Nicole was grateful for her job at the CSA, even though she was in it more for the space stuff than the climate stuff. However, it was moments like this where it really clicked for her. The space stuff, all the work on the Sovereign Satellite Constellation, paid off to do exactly what she was doing now. With a smile on her face, she got back to staring at her screen, looking for the next signal of something wrong, because where there’s smoke, there’s fire.
