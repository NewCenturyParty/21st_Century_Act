# Part XVII: Implementation

The map is not the place, and the blueprint is not the home, but it helps.

## Title I: Purpose and Principles

### Section 397: Dignified Implementation

(1) The blueprints and implementation set forth in this Part are specific articulations and extensions of the inherent right to Human Dignity, the principles of this Act, and the need for dignity to be rapidly deployed.

(2) Let it be acknowledged that the work of this Act shall be the undertaking of a generation, and that it must be done quickly to ensure those already falling between the cracks do not fall further out of reach.

(3) After such acknowledgement found in subsection (2), let it be known that Canada shall not back down in the face of overwhelming challenges, even in the implementation of the solutions to those challenges, and that this work is done on schedule, in collaboration with Canadians country-wide.

(4) In not backing down, Canada again chooses action, and will do so through the lens of Human Dignity and the foundational principles of this Act, ensuring that Canada will not just meet the moment, but meet it with a plan already in motion.

## Title II: Framework for Dignity-Based Federalism

### Section 398: The Principle of Partnership

(1) The Government of Canada recognizes that the full realization of the vision of this Act requires deep and respectful collaboration with provincial, territorial, municipal, and Indigenous governing bodies, honouring their distinct constitutional jurisdictions, responsibilities, and wisdom.

(2) This Act does not seek to impose its frameworks unilaterally, but rather to establish national goals and to offer a robust federal partnership with any province, territory, municipality, or Indigenous governing body that chooses to work toward these shared objectives for the well-being of the people they serve.

### Section 399: An Invitation to Shared Standards

(1) For all matters within this Act that fall under jurisdiction that is not federal or shared, such as healthcare, education, housing, and social services, the national standards and programs established within this Act shall serve as a benchmark and an invitation for partnership.

(2) The Government of Canada, through the institutions in this Act, such as the Century Bank and the National Renewal Fund shall make available dedicated, long-term, and predictable funding, technical support, and data-sharing capabilities to any province or territory that commits to adopting, co-developing or meeting and adopting these national standards, programs and goals.

### Section 400: The Intergovernmental Council

(1) To facilitate a collaborative approach to the implementation of this Act, with the provinces and territories of Canada, a permanent Intergovernmental Council for National Renewal is hereby established, otherwise known as the ICNR, to be co-chaired by the federal Minister responsible for Intergovernmental Affairs and a rotating provincial and territorial co-chair.

(2) The mandate of this Council shall be to:

    (a) Serve as the primary forum for discussing and negotiating the partnership and funding agreements as described in this Act;

    (b) Share best practices and innovative solutions for implementing dignity-based policies across jurisdictions; and

    (c) Resolve disputes and challenges related to intergovernmental cooperation under this Act.

## Title III: Sprint Governance and the Relay Model

### Section 401: General Principles

(1) The implementation of this 21st Century Act shall be guided by a Sprint Governance model using the Relay Model methodology, as defined under section 3 of this Act, to ensure focused delivery, manageable budgets, and sustained momentum across all pillars.

(2) Sprint Governance is operationalized by major reforms and initiatives being grouped into strategic sprints via the Relay Model, aligned with annual or multi-year objectives. Each initiative shall be tracked and reviewed by the Foundation Commission, with relevant bodies participating in or supporting the sprint where appropriate, with ongoing public engagement. Each sprint shall include the following:

    (a) Clear narrative framing and publicly commented goals;

    (b) Open dashboards on Aurora, canada.ca, and git.canada.ca for progress tracking;

    (c) Quarterly dignity and performance audits where applicable; and

    (d) Policy retrospectives upon the conclusion of sprints to inform future actions.

(3) The Foundation Commission shall have the authority to formally constitute and empower Sprint Teams for defined periods and objectives. Sprint teams shall be tasked with the following:

    (a) Recruiting personnel from relevant government departments, agencies, the Canadian Century Corps, or include external expertise as required;

    (b) Forming operational plans that are co-developed with, and respect the ongoing mandates of, any primary institutions established under this Act that have direct jurisdiction over the matter of the sprint; and

    (c) Operating with clear terms of reference defined by the Foundation Commission, outlining their objectives, deliverables, timelines and reporting obligations to both the Foundation Commission and any relevant Minister or institution.

(4) The Foundation Commission may allocate operational resources for these teams from funds designated for the implementation of this Act, subject to parliamentary approval and subsequent appropriations.

(5) All Sprint Governance and Relay Model activities, including budgeting and expenditures for Sprint Teams shall operate within the fiscal accountability frameworks established by law, with the Foundation Commission providing oversight on Sprint specific budgetary performance and reporting.

(6) The Foundation Commission shall establish a framework to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of Sprint Governance and the Relay Model methodologies themselves, ensuring these implementation processes are subject to continuous improvement and adaptation.

(7) The Relay Model’s implementation may be structured as a multi-year relay of as many sprints, with a dedicated Sprint Team taking the lead on specific pillars or ‘legs’ of the relay, implementing a significant specific part of this Act, all the while other Sprint Teams shall conduct preparatory work for their own upcoming sprints implementing their specified part of the Act. This model includes, but is not limited to, the following:

    (a) Defined teams within each Sprint Team responsible for planning, execution, and the formal document transfer of knowledge, lessons learned, and relevant data to subsequent teams as overseen by the Foundation Commission, ensuring such transfers are a baton passing, not a stop and start;

    (b) Four to five different Sprints, or legs, of the relay, ensuring roughly one sprint leg per year between elections;

    (c) A publicly outlined relay plan indicating active and preparatory legs for each implementation year, hosted on git.canada.ca, canada.ca, and Aurora; and

    (d) Continuous background work, including chapter drafting, site scouting, tool development, and legislative framework preparation for upcoming legs or sprints.

(8) The Foundation Commission, in consultation with the Office for the Future, shall establish and oversee the detailed operationalization of Sprint Governance and its Relay Model, ensuring its adaptability, and alignment with the Act’s objectives and principles.

(9) Public transparency of Sprint Governance and its Relay Model shall be maintained through platforms such as git.canada.ca, canada.ca, and Aurora, which must include narrative relay summaries, team charters, milestone boards, and public retrospectives.

## Title IV: Governance and Accountability Loops

### Section 402: The Foundation Commission’s Role

(1) The Foundation Commission shall serve as the central node of this 21st Century Act’s governance and implementation frameworks, ensuring accountability, transparency, and responsiveness across all its components. Its strategic priorities for implementation and identified funding needs shall directly inform its advice regarding allocation of funds from the National Renewal Fund, as established in Part X of this Act.

(2) The Foundation Commission shall provide regular reports to Parliament and the public on the overall progress, challenges, and impacts of this 21st Century Act, utilizing data from Statistics Canada, and insights from Democracy Watch Canada.

### Section 403: Feedback and Iteration Mechanisms of this Act

(1) This Act is designed with inherent feedback and iteration mechanisms including:

    (a) The Dignity Impact Assessment, provides upfront assessment and ongoing monitoring of policy impacts;

    (b) The Dignity Evaluation Framework, ensures programs meet minimum dignity thresholds and are subject to corrective action;

    (c) The Intergenerational Impact Assessment, provides upfront assessment and ongoing monitoring of policy impacts, and pathway to corrective action;

    (d) The Environmental Impact Assessment, provides upfront assessment and ongoing monitoring of policy impacts, and a pathway to corrective action;
