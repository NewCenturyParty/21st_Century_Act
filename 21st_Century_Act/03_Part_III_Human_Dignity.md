(3) There is hereby established a new requirement for eligibility for all new recruits joining the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Canadian Security Intelligence Service, which is a Bachelor degree in a Social Science, such as Sociology, ensuring they have a comprehensive understanding of the society, and the injustices of it, they so seek to police.

(4) The review set forth in subsection (3) above shall be submitted to the Dignity Directorate for review and subsequent binding recommendation on how to unbundle these areas of expertise to ensure that the appropriate public service meet the specific need (e.g., mental health crises are responded to by unarmed mental health professionals rather than armed peace officers as primary response).

    (b) An order requiring a federal entity to cease an infringing act or to take positive steps to fulfill the right;

    (d) Monetary compensation for loss or injury suffered.

### Section 77: Right of Action and Remedies

(1) A person directly affected by an alleged breach of any statutory entitlement created by this Act or its regulations, or any minimum standard prescribed under this Act, may bring a civil proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction for appropriate relief.

    (a) there is serious justiciable issue;

    (b) The claimant has a genuine interest; and

    (c) The proceeding is a reasonable and effective means to bring the issue before the court.

(3) The standard of review shall be thus:

    (a) For statutory entitlements (e.g., eligibility and payment of the Dignity Dividend): the issue is compliance; and

(4) Regulations made by the Governor in Council, may define minimum core standards for each right or program; failure to meet minimum core obligations without compelling justification is presumptively unreasonable.

(5) The court may grant declaratory relief, mandamus, prohibitions, and structural orders, including timelines, reporting, and supervisory jurisdiction. Monetary damages are limited to amounts wrongfully withheld under a statutory entitlement and costs.

(6) Once a claimant shows a prima facie breach, the onus shifts to the responding authority to show reasonableness and resource justification.
