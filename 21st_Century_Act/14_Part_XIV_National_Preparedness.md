The future is coming, ready or not.

## Title I: Purpose and Principles

(2) Let it be acknowledged that such times of crisis are happening more often, with climate related disasters an increasingly common occurrence, and future crises are on the horizon such as population decline, further, more extreme, climate disasters, or another worldwide public health event.

(3) After such acknowledgment as in subsection (2) above, let it be known the Government of Canada has the obligation to prepare for and prevent further crises in Canada, and will take the necessary actions to do so.

(4) In choosing action, the Government of Canada will do so through the lens of Human Dignity, and the foundational principles of this Act, ensuring that Canada will be ready to meet the moment as it arrives.

(3) Emergency Circle governance protocols and participatory continuity plans shall be developed and made publicly accessible on Aurora to ensure the continuation of democratic functions and citizen engagement during crises.
