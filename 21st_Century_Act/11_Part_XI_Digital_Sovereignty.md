## Title I: Purpose and Principles of Digital Sovereignty

### Section 274: Digital Dignity

## Title IV: Foundational Digital Infrastructure

### Section 288: The Digital Social Insurance Number

(1) Every individual in Canada is hereby eligible for a secure, strictly opt-in, and privacy preserving digital identity known as a Digital Social Insurance Number, otherwise known as a DSIN.

(2) The DSIN is hereby established to serve as the unique, secure, and strictly private foundational identifier used to create such things as @canadapost.ca email accounts, which are then used to create secure digital accounts for other platforms such as Aurora.

(3) Each DSIN shall be a unique, randomly generated, alphanumerical identifier of no less than sixty-four (64) characters, assigned to an individual upon their own in-person application for a DSIN at participating locations such as Canada Post Offices, Dignity Hubs, and Service Canada offices.

(4) Each DSIN shall, through privacy-by-design principles, not be shared with its associated citizen unless specifically requested, to ensure absolute security. Instead, citizens will be given a metal card, known as their DSIN Card, with a QR code engraved on it at the time of first application.

(5) Acquiring a DSIN and DSIN Card shall be done through various service providers, primarily Canada Post Offices, Service Canada Offices, and eligible Dignity Hubs. The full application process shall be prescribed by regulations, but shall, at a minimum, include the following:

    (a) The requirement to show the officer distributing the DSIN and DSIN Card, the applying individual’s SIN Card and then a government issued photo ID which must be copied and securely stored and tied to the DSIN for future verification purposes;

    (b) The asking and creation of unique security questions and their answers for the individual applying; and

    (c) The issuance of a metal DSIN Card, which shall be laser engraved with a personal QR code, as defined under section 3 of this Act, on-site at time of successful application.

(6) Upon scanning a citizen's DSIN Card’s QR code the individual will be taken to a personal, individually tied to a citizen’s DSIN, secure, and private webpage, created and run by the Canada Digital Public Square Corporation, as detailed under this Part, that prompts the citizen to either create a new @canadapost.ca email, to reset the password of an already established @canadapost.ca email, or change the identification information, such as photo ID, provided upon initial application. Each option requires the citizen to go through the Dignified Identity Verification Protocol.

(7) The Dignity Identity Verification Protocol will be further detailed in regulations, but shall include at a minimum, the following:

    (a) A high-quality photograph of the applicant that does not have any obstruction to their entire face;

    (b) A series of security questions, made and answered by the applying individual when first applying in-person for a DSIN;

    (c) Human authentication measures such as reCAPTCHA or similar programs;

    (d) A mandatory video call with a reviewing officer, before the end of the process, that requires the applying citizen to do the following:

        (i) Follow the instructions of the officer conducting the call, which may include physical movements or verbal confirmations, ensuring the applying individual is a living human being and not a deepfake AI.

        (ii) Showing a government issued photo identification to the reviewing officer, ensuring it matches with what was put on file during the initial application or any subsequent updates to such identification.

    (e) After ensuring they are not only human, but the matching human to the DSIN the citizen will be verbally and visually given a code to write down, which is then used on the website to allow the citizen to complete either a password reset or create a new email account, or change identification information;

    (f) Specific procedures to ensure a dignified, respectful, and affirming process for individuals updating their personal information, including their name, gender marker, or photograph, for verification or personal purposes, with the primary purpose being the presentation of a new valid legal documentation and photo identification. Such procedures shall require that:

        (i) Verification officers receive mandatory training on cultural sensitivity, gender diversity, and trauma-informed practices.

        (ii) Should the newly presented photo identification and legal documentation indicate an individual has transitioned genders, the reviewing officer shall not deny the update solely based on perceived visual mismatches between the new photograph and old photograph of an individual; and

        (iii) Individuals shall have a right to an immediate review by a senior officer if their update request is denied, and a clear, simple process for review and appeal.

(8) The DSIN shall be distinct from and not replace the Social Insurance Number, issued under the Department of Employment and Social Development Act. The DSIN shall be exclusively used for the purposes of digital identity, linking things such as a citizen’s National Learning Wallet, as detailed under Part VIII of this Act, or the @canadapost.ca email accounts created from said DSIN.

(9) The DSIN shall not be used for any other purpose, unless explicitly authorized by subsequent primary legislation that includes commensurate privacy and security safeguards, and a comprehensive Dignity Impact Assessment, reviewed by the Dignity Directorate.

(10) For greater certainty the DSIN shall not be required, requested, or utilized by any private corporate, for-profit or non-profit entity, for any purpose.

(11) A contravention of this section is a violation for the purposes of Title V of Part XVII of this Act.

(12) The creation, back-end design, management, security, and revocation of the DSIN, and its associated @canadapost.ca email accounts, shall be the responsibility of the Canada Digital Public Square Corporation, as detailed under this Part, in partnership with Canada Post.

(13) The regulations governing the DSIN system shall be developed by the responsible Minister in consultation with the Privacy Commissioner and the Canada Digital Public Square Corporation. Such regulations shall, at a minimum, establish:

    (a) Eligibility criteria and the application process for obtaining a DSIN in participating locations, with the criteria specifically stating applications must be done in-person to receive a DSIN and DSIN Card;

    (b) Robust technical and operational standards for the generation, secure storage, encryption, access control, and lifecycle management for DSINs, ensuring their confidentiality and integrity;

    (c) Strict purpose limitation, data minimization, and enforcement of the privacy-by-design and zero-trust principles for any data associated with the DSIN;

    (d) Procedures for individuals to access, verify, correct, or request revocation of their DSIN and or associated @canadapost.ca emails and their data;

    (e) Requirements for regular, independent security and privacy audits of the DSIN system; and

    (f) Requirements that any access to the central DSIN registry by a government body for administrative or law enforcement purposes requires a judicial warrant.

(14) A DSIN shall remain constant throughout a citizen’s lifetime, with exceptions made for times when a DSIN has been compromised.

(15) Citizens may create and manage multiple @canadapost.ca email addresses or accounts for distinct purposes, but all emails shall be linked to their singular DSIN.

(16) As prescribed by regulations, certain public-interest service providers, such as government bodies like the CRA or healthcare providers, but never private interests, or for-profit corporations of any kind, may be authorized to deliver essential communications directly to a citizen's DSIN. Such messages shall appear in all active inboxes of email addresses associated with that DSIN, ensuring important messages are not missed due to disuse of a particular email address.

(17) The DSIN, and its associated features, such as the @canadapost.ca email accounts, shall be designed with privacy-first, privacy-by-design, security-by-design, and zero-trust principles and architectures, ensuring that the DSIN provides a secure backend identifier, individual can manage their public-facing @canadapost.ca email account addresses and associated profile information with appropriate levels of privacy and pseudonymity where permissible and desired. A citizen’s DSIN must never be shared or publicly exposed or required outside of specified situations found in this Act or detailed in new primary legislation.

(18) The Privacy Commissioner of Canada shall have full oversight and audit powers with respect to the DSIN system and the associated @canadapost.ca email accounts to ensure compliance with this Act and all applicable privacy legislation.

(19) The Governor in Council may make regulations to establish a secure and dignified remote verification protocol for individuals who, due to disability, geographical remoteness, or other exceptional circumstances, are unable to apply for a DSIN in-person. Such a protocol must meet or exceed the security standards of in-person verification.

### Section 289: The @canadapost.ca Email Service

(2) There is hereby established a Digital Stamp Wallet, linked with an individual’s DSIN, that tracks and collects the individuals purchased or gifted Digital Stamps of both varieties, with functionalities allowing for the exchange of Digital Stamps between individuals or from Canada Post, or the Canada Digital Public Square Corporation’s Digital Stamp Exchange detailed herein.

(3) Digital Stamps shall be issued, sold and redeemed by Canada Post, as federally recognized micro-payments in the following two primary forms:

    (a) An Email Digital Stamp, otherwise known as an Email Stamp, fixed at a value of $0.01 CAD, shall be required for the transmission of all outgoing electronic mail from verified national accounts with addresses using @canadapost.ca email domains. This requirement is intended to affirm the human origin of such correspondence and to economically disincentivize spam;

        (i) To ensure equitable access and prevent undue hardship, regulations made under this section shall establish a transparent and accessible mechanism for individuals whose income falls below a certain threshold. The Canada Revenue Agency shall automatically distribute Email Digital Stamps at a value of $25 per month to individuals who qualify under these regulations, ensuring adequate email capacity;

    (b) A Reaction Digital Stamp, otherwise known as a Reaction Stamp, fixed at a value of $0.02 CAD, shall be optionally applied by citizens on the Aurora platform to award or acknowledge posts or reposts, positively or negatively, through predefined digital emoji Reaction Stamp markers displayed on the post or response on Aurora (e.g., 👍👎✅👏⁉️😡🗣️). The value of each Reaction Stamp shall be apportioned as follows:

        (i) Half the value, $0.01 CAD shall, upon purchase, be allocated immediately to the Canada Digital Public Square Corporation, for the maintenance and operational costs of federally run public digital infrastructure.

        (ii) Half the value, $0.01 CAD, shall, upon purchase, be credited as the redeemable value of the stamp. Individuals can redeem their Reaction Stamps through Canada Post for CAD. When a Reaction Stamp is given to a post or a response on Aurora, that stamp is transferred from the giver’s Digital Stamp Wallet, to the receiver’s Digital Stamp Wallet, where the stamp is stored, and total value shown. The particular chosen Reaction Stamp emoji shall then also be shown as attached to the receiver’s post or response on Aurora, acknowledging to the public the exchange and reaction to said post.

(4) The Canada Digital Public Square Corporation, as detailed under this Part, shall establish, maintain, and operate, a transparent digital marketplace, to be known as the Digital Stamp Exchange for the issuance, exchange, and auction of rare or seasonal Reaction Stamps, valued higher than that of a regular emoji Reaction Stamp, that are occasionally requisitioned by the government from Canadian artists, which can be displayed on individual citizen’s profiles on Aurora.

(5) Digital Stamps shall be made available for purchase and redemption online on Canada Post’s website, and in-store at Canada Post’s offices.

(6) While Canada Post shall be responsible for the issuance, sale, and redemption of Digital Stamps, the Canada Digital Public Square Corporation shall partner with Canada Post to provide the technical backend to ensure all promised functionalities operate smoothly for Canadians.

(7) Canada Post must issue tax slips yearly to those who have redeemed more than $500.00 CAD in Reaction Stamps, as it shall be treated as other income for income tax purposes.

The World Circle contains Countries’ Circles, including the Canada Circle, which contains thirteen provinces and territories’ Circles, which each contain Cities’ Circles, which further contain Neighbourhood Circles, going as granular as wanted or needed;

    (b) The ability to post content to the platform, such as photos, videos, audios, or any other digital content, be it original content which shall be hosted on Aurora’s servers, or links to outside content such as another post found on somewhere else on the internet. In this way it shall be an aggregate of content, original and not, and discussion on the internet;

    (c) Freely Up-rank and Down-Rank posts to allow for citizen engagement on post quality and relevancy with no cost;

    (d) The ability to make community-based notes on posts that give further context to said posts;

(4) Future legislation shall be created to allow for international citizens who wish to gain access to Aurora, doing so in cooperation with international partners with the understanding that they must do so through the same verifiably human and dignified processes outlined in this Act, locally, using their national post office to run email address domains (e.g., @lepost.fr, @usps.gov).

(5) The Canada Digital Public Square Corporation, as established under this Part, shall be responsible for the development, maintenance, moderation, operations and governance of the Aurora platform. Such governance shall include the development of transparent, plain-language, and publicly accessible terms of service and moderation policies that uphold the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, while ensuring civic safety, preventing manipulation, and are consistent with the principles of this Act.

(6) A contravention of this section is a violation for the purposes of Title V of Part XVII of this Act.
