# Part XXI: Coming into Force

## Title I: Purpose, Principles, Relays

### Section 455: Purpose and Principles of Phase Implementation

(1) The Government of Canada is committed to enacting the entirety of this Act, with the recognition that some provisions will take longer to operationalize than others and thus there is need to do so in discrete phases, all of which shall be done in accordance with the principles of this Act, found in section 6, and Human Dignity, detailed under Part III of this Act.

(2) In fulfilling its commitment found in subsection (1) above, the Government of Canada shall enact Sprint Governance and the Relay Model, as defined under section 3, and detailed under Part XVII, Title III, where the Government of Canada will enact parts of this Act through a relay made up of four yearly sprints, or ‘legs,’ thus allowing the Government to focus on specific pieces of the Act to implement at a time.

(3) Let it be acknowledged the immense size and scope of this Act and its aims, and that there will be many challenges to overcome, which may be overwhelming, to some.

(4) The Government of Canada shall choose action in the face of such immense challenge and will do so knowing that it is the right thing to do, not just for the present which desperately needs hope, not just for the past, which desperately needs honour, but for the future generations, who desperately need it so they may live and prosper.

### Section 456: Coming into Force by Order

(1) The provisions of this Act, other than this section, come into force on a day or days to be fixed by order of the Governor in Council.

(2) This section comes into force on the day on which this Act receives Royal Assent.

(3) Different provisions may be brought into force on different days.

(4) An order under this section may apply generally or with respect to one or more Parts or sections.

### Section 457: Coming into Force by Phases

(1) The coming into force of the Parts and Titles of this Act shall be conducted in a phased, orderly, and strategic manner, guided by the principles of Sprint Governance and the Relay Model as established under Part XVII, Title III of this Act.

### Section 458: The Implementation Relay

(1) The Governor in Council, on binding the recommendation of the Foundation Commission, shall issue the orders referred to in section 456, in accordance with a Relay. This Relay shall be structured in a series of distinct ‘legs,’ or Sprints, each focusing on a specific cluster of the Act’s Parts and objectives, where one Sprint is ‘active’ and the current year’s work, while the other Sprints do background prep work, getting ready for their own active Sprint.

(2) The initial four-year Implementation Relay shall, at a minimum, consist of the following Sprints:

(3) Relay 1 Sprint 1 \- Foundational Infrastructure (Year 1): Focusing on the full operational establishment of institutions such as:

    (a) the Foundation Commission;

    (b) The Dignity Directorate;

    (c) Century Bank;

    (d) The Canadian Century Corps, particularly its Administration and Logistics Corps;

    (e) National Council for Reconciliation; and

    (f) The renewed mandate and operations of the Canada Revenue Agency.

(2) Relay 1 Sprint 2 \- Economic Democracy (Year 2): Focusing on the principles of Economic Democracy, as detailed in this Act, operationalizing the following:

    (a) The Dignity Dividend and the Child Dignity Dividend; and

    (b) The Fair Taxation measures outlined in Part X of this Act.

(3) Relay 1 Sprint 3 \- The Human Capital Engine (Year 3): Focusing on the full implementation of Part VIII of this Act, including the full recruitment, training, and deployment of the Canadian Century Corps across all foundational streams, building on the preparatory work of the Administration and Logistics Corps from Sprint 1; and

(4) Relay 1 Sprint 4 \- Digital Sovereignty (Year 4): Focusing on the full implementation of Part XI of this Act, including the launch of CenTel, the Canadian Digital Civic Tech Stack that includes the @canadapost.ca email service, Guardian, Aurora, the DSIN, and git.canada.ca.

(5) Prior to the commencement of each Sprint, the Foundation Commission shall prepare a detailed operational plan and budget. This budget shall be submitted to the Treasury Board for approval and subsequent appropriation of funds from the National Renewal Fund or the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The Foundation Commission shall publicly report on the approved budget and expenditures for each Sprint in accordance with its mandate to ensure public transparency.

### Section 459: Review and Adaptation

(1) The Foundation Commission shall, at the conclusion of each Sprint or ‘leg’ of the Relay, conduct a comprehensive review and submit a report to Parliament and the public, on the overall implementation of that Sprint, which may include recommendations for adjusting the sequence or timing of subsequent legs to ensure the effective and dignified implementation of this Act.

(2) In the event that a Sprint is projected to significantly fail to meet its core objectives, timelines, or budgetary constraints, the Foundation Commission, pursuant to its oversight mandate under Part VII of this Act, shall have the authority to require the responsible Sprint Team to submit a corrective action plan. The Foundation Commission may issue binding directives regarding the plan’s implementation to ensure the integrity and momentum of the relay are maintained.

### Section 460: Co-operative Implementation

(1) The purpose of this section is to reiterate the need for Dignity-Based Federalism, to implement this Act through co-operative arrangements that respect constitutional jurisdictions while ensuring national minimum standards of dignity, access, and non-discrimination.

(2) The Minister responsible may enter into bilateral or multilateral agreements with a province, territory, or Indigenous Government concerning the design, delivery, or enforcement of programs under this Act.

(3) Regulations may prescribe national minimum standards, such as service levels, eligibility floors, timelines, portability, and data safeguards. Parties may exceed but not fall below these minimums.

(4) Where a jurisdiction demonstrates substantive equivalency to the national minimums through its own laws or programs, the Minister must recognize equivalency and exempt that jurisdiction from duplicative federal requirements for a period of renewable equivalency, subject to period review.

(5) Payments may be made under this Act using time-limited agreements, statutory transfers, or results-based contributions tied to the national minimums.

(6) Nothing in this Act displaces valid provincial laws except in the case of an operational conflict with a minimum standard expressly designated as paramount by regulation.

(7) For programs requiring local rights-of-way, permitting, or utility interconnection, agreements may include municipalities and regulated utilities, including standard-form easements and service-level agreements.

(8) Disputes arising under an agreement must include a staged process, with dialogue leading to mediation leading to independent expert recommendation; binding arbitration only where parties agree.

(9) All agreements, equivalency decisions, and compliance reports must be published within 30 days, subject to privacy and Cabinet confidences.

(10) Nothing in this section abrogates or derogates from Indigenous, Aboriginal, or treaty rights; where self-government agreements assign program fields, the Crown shall negotiate directly with the Indigenous government on a nation-to-nation basis.
