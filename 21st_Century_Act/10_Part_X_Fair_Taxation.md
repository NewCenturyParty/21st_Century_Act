### Section 255: Dignity in Taxation

(2) In fulfilling its commitments detailed in subsection (1), the Government of Canada shall enact Fair Taxation, a system of taxation that increases taxes on those with the most and removes taxes on those with the least, ensuring that every Canadian can lead a life of dignity, funded by the wealth this country generates, which shall no longer be hoarded by the few.

(3) Let it be acknowledged that the hoarding of wealth is a threat to National Security that could tear apart the social fabric of Canada, and that the Government of Canada has an obligation to act.

(4) The Government of Canada, in choosing action in the face of such power, wealth, and status, reasserts the position of the people, through their Government, above corporations and wealthy elites, and shall do so through the lens of Human Dignity, and the foundational principles of this Act, ensuring all individuals in Canada have the resources to create a life of dignity.

### Section 264: Capital Gains

    (a) Define the thresholds for what constitutes a ‘significant portion’ of economic value derived from automation;

(4) The wealth tax and other fair taxation measures established under this Part allow for wealth to circle back into the community via the National Renewal Fund, as detailed under this Part, allowing for the full funding of the various provisions and projects of this Act, including and particularly the Dignity Dividend.

(5) Century Bonds act as a tool for intergenerational wealth circulation, spreading the burden of debt across up to 100 years, allowing investments made today in housing, infrastructure, care, and climate to be repaid through the shared prosperity created over the next century, and not burden a single generation with debt.

(6) Procurement standards under the Act shall favour circular, ethical, and local supply chains, allowing public contracts to generate value not just in delivery but in strengthening domestic industry and ecological resilience.
