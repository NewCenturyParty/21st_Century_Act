# Part XVI: National Goals and Moonshots

Nothing is outside humanities reach, on Earth or otherwise.

## Title I: Purpose and Principles of Moonshots

### Section 384: Dignity in Shooting for the Moon

(1) The goals and aspirations found within this Part are specific articulations and extensions of the inherent right to Human Dignity, and the application of the principles of this Act, as detailed under section 6, with respect to national goals and moonshots, ensuring the human need to explore is ever satisfied.

(2) The Government of Canada is committed to connecting the country like never before and seeking our place in the stars above, giving hope to Canadians that there is nothing Canada cannot do when done with its people united.

(3) Let it be acknowledged that there is nothing outside of humanity’s reach, having gone to the literal Moon and back, and that such projects done on Earth that connect us to each other and to the stars are not only a necessity for the human soul, but a necessity in planting our flag not just on a celestial body, but in the future itself.

(4) Therefore, the Government of Canada chooses action, and will do so through the lens of Human Dignity, as detailed under Part III, and the principles of this Act, as detailed under section 6 of this Act, ensuring that Canada will meet the moment, connected, together, ready, and on guard.

    (a) Specialized rolling stock on shared tracks during off-peak passenger hours; and

    (b) The development of specific secondary maglev freight tracks, with the understanding that while there would be much greater costs, the benefits may outweigh them.

(4) The Maglev Network will aim for maximum operational speeds enabling coast to coast-to-coast passenger travel in significantly reduced timeframes, with a suggested target operational speed of at least 600 km/h, with scalability capacity in mind when designed to meet maximum projected long-term demands.

(5) The Maglev Network will be developed with the ultimate vision of connecting all major Canadian urban centres and regions from the Atlantic, to the Pacific, to the Arctic, ensuring comprehensive national coverage through a phased approach.

(6) Stations on the Maglev Network will be designed as multi-model, accessible, transportation hubs integrated with local and regional public transit, active transportation networks, and sustainable urban development. Station planning prioritizes co-location with, or seamless connection with, 21st Century Neighbourhoods and Dignity Hubs where feasible.

### Section 389: Governance

(1) The exact governance for such a project as the Maglev Network shall be decided upon completion of the comprehensive feasibility studies, as set out in Title II of this Part, including deciding whether such governance is better run by an Agency of the Government of Canada, a division within Transport Canada, or a new Crown Corporation following Loop Governance. Once such studies are completed the Government of Canada will have one year to respond and act according to the studies recommended form of governance.
