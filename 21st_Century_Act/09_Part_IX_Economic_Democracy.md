(3) Let it be acknowledged that we are in the later stages of Capitalism, with the system crumbling, soon to collapse in on itself, due to it only serving the few, rather than the public at large, and that the Government of Canada has an obligation to create an economy that serves every Canadian, no matter their wealth or background, and that the prosperity of Canada must be shared by the Canadian workers who create it.

(4) The Government of Canada shall choose action in the face of such oncoming economic systemic collapse, and shall take such actions through the lens of Human Dignity, and the foundational principles of this Act, ensuring that all individuals in Canada have access to economic opportunities and democratic decision-making in how their work is done.
