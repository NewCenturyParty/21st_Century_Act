# Part XVIII: Constitutional Entrenchment

Shoring up the foundation of the House that is Canada.

## Title I: Purpose and Principles of Entrenchment

### Section 418: Dignity in Constitutional Renewal

(1) The Government of Canada is committed to enacting the right to Human Dignity, as detailed under Part III of this Act, and shall do so in accordance with the principles found in section 6\.

(2) In fulfilling its commitment set out in subsection (1), the Government of Canada shall amend the Constitution Act to entrench this foundational right, that gives birth to all other rights, entitlements, and programs throughout this Act.

(3) Let it be acknowledged that there are those who would wish to undo this Act, undo its foundational principle of Human Dignity, so that they can continue to rule as the few over the many, and let it be known that they have immense power and patience, resulting in a need to take definitive action.

(4) Following the acknowledgment in subsection (3) above, let it be known that the Government of Canada shall choose action, ensuring that the core of this Act, the foundation for the rights granted thereafter, must be entrenched and hardened in the foundation of Canadian law, the Constitution, to ensure none may take away what rightfully belongs to Canadians.

## Title II: Proposed Amendments

### Section 419: Entrenching Human Dignity

(1) The Constitution Act, 1982, is hereby amended by adding the following immediately after section 7:

    7.1 Right to Human Dignity

    Everyone has the right to Human Dignity, which is absolutely inviolable, and the Government of Canada has a duty, within its jurisdiction, to protect that right.

    7.2 The Right to a Healthy Environment

    Everyone has the right to a Healthy Environment, and it is the duty of the Government of Canada, within its jurisdiction, to protect that right.

(2) All other sections are renumbered to reflect the addition of two new sections.

## Title III: The Post-Monarchy Head of State

### Section 420: Further Constitutional Amendments

(1) The Constitutional documents of Canada shall be amended to remove all mention of the Monarchy, to be replaced instead by the Office of the Future Steward, or their own chosen name.

(2) Further, there shall be a new Constitutional Document of Canada, that fully establishes and gives powers to the Office of the Future Steward, or their own chosen name, formally enacting them as the Head of State of the Republic of Canada, using the work of the co-development processes as detailed under Part VI of this Act.

## Title IV: Democratic Pathway for Entrenchment

### Section 421: A Phased Approach

(1) The entrenchment of the right to Human Dignity and the right to a healthy environment in the Constitution of Canada shall be pursued through a patient, transparent, and democratic multi-stage process, designed to build broad public and intergovernmental consensus.

(2) The process of entrenchment shall unfold in the following phases:

    (a) Phase 1 - Statutory Implementation and Evidence Gathering - the primary focus following the coming into force of this Act shall be on the successful implementation and the statutory rights and programs found throughout this Act. The Government of Canada shall prioritize demonstrating the tangible benefits of these rights through their rapid deployment and enactment;

    (b) Phase 2 - National Dialogue and Deliberation - following a comprehensive five-year review by the Foundation Commission on the statutory implementation of the rights granted by the 21st Century Act, the Government of Canada shall sponsor:

        (i) A National Citizens’ Assembly on Human Dignity, composed of citizens selected by civic lottery, to deliberate on the proposed right to Human Dignity amendment for the Constitution.

        (ii) A National Citizens’ Assembly on the right to a healthy environment, similarly composed through civic lottery, to deliberate on the proposed right to a healthy environment amendment to the Constitution;

        (iii) Both assemblies shall hold public hearings, consult with relevant experts and Indigenous nations, be held in every province and territory, and produce reports with recommendations for Parliament and all provincial and territorial legislatures.

    (c) Phase 3 - Formal Intergovernmental Public Consultation - based on the recommendations of the Citizens’ Assemblies the Government of Canada shall enter into formal negotiations with provincial and territorial governments to seek consent for the proposed amendments. This phase will also include widespread public consultation on the final proposed wording of the amendments and the referendum question via platforms such as Aurora, public libraries, Dignity Hubs, and Post Offices; and

    (d) Phase 4 - Constitutional Resolution - only after a broad consensus is demonstrably achieved through the aforementioned phases shall the Prime Minister introduce a resolution in Parliament to formally authorize the amendments in accordance with the procedure set out in the Constitution Act, 1982.

(3) The Minister of Justice, in collaboration with the Office for the Future, and the Foundation Commission, shall prepare and publicly release an annual report on the progress of this pathway, including the outcomes of Citizens’ Assemblies and intergovernmental consultations.

### Section 422: The Eight Year Transition Timeline Affirmation

(1) As stated in Part VI, Title I of this Act, the vote, meaning referendum for a new Head of State shall occur no later than the eighth year of the coming into force of this Act, following the consultation and co-development provisions as detailed under Part VI.
