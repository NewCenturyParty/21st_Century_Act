# Part VI: The Post-Monarchy Head of State

Power shared is power secured.

## Title I: Framework for Transition

### Section 157: Affirmation of a Sovereign Future

(1) This Act affirms that Canada’s sovereignty is not something to be inherited, but something to be created and continually renewed through shared, democratic, and co-developed processes.

(2) The framework for the transition to a Canadian Head of State, as further detailed in this Part, particularly in Title II concerning the Office of the Future Steward, is established as a deliberate, ceremonial, and democratic process guided by the principle of continuity through renewal, as defined under section 3 of this Act.

(3) This transition shall ensure that any symbolic office embodies Canadian sovereignty with humility, service, and moral courage, flowing from the people.

### Section 158: Eight-Year Transition Timeline

(1) An eight-year transition plan for the new Head of State framework shall commence upon the coming into force of this Act, facilitated and co-managed by the National Council for Reconciliation, as established in Part V of this Act, in partnership with provincial, territorial, and Indigenous governing bodies.

(2) The structure, sequencing, and specifics of this transition shall be primarily established in regulation, recognizing the need for comprehensive co-development and partnership with Indigenous nations, elders, youth, knowledge keepers, and Treaty organizations across Canada in any such regulation development.

(3) The transition shall include, at minimum, the following components:

(4) The convening of a Citizens’ Assembly, facilitated by the National Council for Reconciliation in every province and territory, composed of:

    (a) Citizens selected via Civic lottery, as defined under section 3 of this act; and

    (b) Indigenous representatives selected by the Assembly of First Nations, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, and the Métis National Council.

(2) A comprehensive public learning and deliberation process to educate Citizens’ Assemblies, and all citizens on:

    (a) The meaning and purpose of the transition to a domestic, ceremonial, Head of State.

    (b) The proposed models outlined under this Part of this Act; and

    (c) The principles of continuity through renewal, circular democracy, and Indigenous-led constitutional symbolism.

(3) The primary object of the eight-year transition shall be to enable Indigenous and non-Indigenous Canadians to co-develop a new ceremonial institution, rooted in shared sovereignty and democratic humility, to succeed the Crown as the symbolic Head of State.

(4) A final vote on constitutional reform shall occur no later than the eighth year of this Act coming into force, subject to Indigenous consultation, provincial and territorial collaboration, and the entrenchment processes detailed in Part XVIII of this Act.

## Title II: The Office of the Future Steward

### Section 159: Affirmation of the Office

(1) An office to serve as Canada’s new Head of State, provisionally referred herein to as the Office of the Future Stewards, otherwise known as the Future Stewards, as defined under section 3 of this Act, is proposed as the successor to the Office of the Governor General, and the Monarchy overall, with its final name, nature, and functions to be submitted to Parliament by the National Council for Reconciliation, following the completion of the co-development process.

(2) The Future Stewards shall serve as a symbolic custodian of Canada’s long story, embodying the values of dignity, democracy, care, and circular governance.

### Section 160: Composition and Selection

(1) The precise composition and selection process for the Future Stewards shall be finalized through the broad national consultation and co-development processes mandated by this Part, facilitated by the National Council for Reconciliation, and shall be subject to constitutional amendment as outlined in Part XVIII of this Act.

(2) Potential models for the Future Stewards include, but are not limited to:

(3) A Youth and Elder Council Model, composed of:

    (a) Nine youths, aged 16-27 years, selected through transparent civic processes.

    (b) Nine elders, aged 60 years and above, selected through transparent civic processes; and

    (c) Two Treaty Keepers, in rotating positions selected from every treaty nation, ensuring Indigenous leadership and knowledge integration.

(2) A Stewardship Council Model, a small body composed of:

    (a) One or more Elder or Knowledge Keeper.

    (b) One or more citizen chosen by civic lottery;

    (c) One or more Civic historian(s) or Scholars;

    (d) One or more Treaty Keeper(s), selected by and from the Treaty Renewal Council established in Part V of this Act.

(3) A model similar to the Loop Governance model, detailed in Part II, Title I of this Act.

### Section 161: Proposed Powers, Duties, and Limitations

(1) It is envisioned that the Future Stewards will be entrusted with specific, carefully circumscribed powers and duties, designed to safeguard constitutional principles and democratic integrity without impinging upon the supremacy of the elected Parliament.

(2) A core proposed ceremonial and constitutional tool for consideration is a ‘Pause and Reflect,’ power as described in section 3 of this Act. This power shall include:

(3) The capacity to delay assent to legislation deemed to fundamentally violate core constitutional principles or the dignity provisions of this Act, triggering the ‘Pause and Reflect’ power, where Parliament ‘Pauses,’ such legislation, which is a mandatory period for parliamentary reconsideration for no less than six months, after which a supermajority of two-thirds of Parliament voting in favour is required to pass the bill again, overriding the delayed assent;

(2) When the ‘Pause and Reflect’ power is triggered, during the ‘Pause’ there shall be ‘Reflection’ with the legislation being sent to the Supreme Court of Canada for an advisory opinion on its constitutionality, as well as its effect on Human Dignity in Canada, which must be published within six months, as to be ready for Parliament to review before another vote on such legislation; and

(3) Mechanisms to be co-developed that protect core democratic institutions or processes from egregious executive or legislative overreach, potentially triggering national deliberations or review processes.

(4) The duties of the Future Stewards shall be primarily symbolic, ceremonial, and custodial in nature, including acting as a symbol of national unity, a guardian of Canada’s national story, and its democratic evolutions. They shall be an embodiment of the values of Human Dignity, democracy, care, and circular governance. It is explicitly envisioned that the Future Stewards shall not govern, initiate policy, or possess independent executive power, and shall not be able to veto duly enacted legislation indefinitely.

(5) The cultural role and democratic legitimacy of the Future Stewards shall include presiding over national civic ceremonies, issuing forms of national recognition, maintaining symbolic public spaces for reflection and civic dialogue, and fostering youth engagement in democracy. The specifics of these roles shall be co-developed in regulation with Indigenous nations.

(6) The precise powers, duties, limitations, and cultural roles of the Future Stewards shall be finalized through consultative co-development and constitutional amendment processes outlined in Part XVIII of this Act, ensuring they reflect broad national consensus and deep partnership with Indigenous Nations.
