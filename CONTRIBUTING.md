# Contributing to The 21st Century Act

First of all, thank you. By simply being here, you are taking an active role in reimagining Canada's future. This project is founded on the belief that our nation's direction should be a shared codebase, written by and for all its residents. Every contribution, no matter how small, is a vital act of civic participation.

This document provides a set of guidelines for contributing to The 21st Century Act. We are aiming to collaboratively develop this from its current **Version 0.8.3** to a polished **Version 1.0**.

## Code of Conduct

This project is, at its heart, about building a society rooted in Human Dignity. We expect all participants to adhere to that principle in every interaction. To ensure this remains a safe, respectful, and collaborative space, all contributors are expected to follow our **[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**. Please take a moment to read it before you participate.

## How You Can Contribute

### Start or Join a Discussion (The Best Place to Begin)

The most important way to contribute is by sharing your ideas. We use **GitHub Issues** as our main forum for discussing the Act.

* **Have a question or a new idea?** [Click here to open a new "Issue"](https://github.com/YourUsername/21st-century-act/issues/new/choose) and start a conversation.
* **Want to talk about a specific Part?** Check the existing issues first. If no one is talking about it, start a new one! Please make your title clear, like: `[Part III] Discussion on the Dignity Dividend`.

### Propose a Change (The Easy Web-Based Way)

If you see something you'd like to change directly—from a typo to a new paragraph—you can submit a "Pull Request." Think of it as submitting a **suggestion slip** with your proposed edits for everyone to review.

You can do this entirely on the GitHub website, no downloads or terminal needed.

**1. Find the File You Want to Edit**
Navigate to the file you want to change inside the `21st_Century_Act/` folder.

**2. Click the Edit Icon**
At the top right of the file's content, click the small **pencil icon ✏️**.


**3. Make Your Edits**
An in-browser text editor will open. Make your changes directly to the text.
**4. Describe Your Suggestion**
Scroll to the bottom of the page. You'll see a section called **"Propose changes."**

* In the first box, write a short, clear title for your suggestion (e.g., `Corrected a typo in Section 125`).
* In the larger box below, briefly explain *why* you're making the change.

**5. Submit Your Suggestion**
Click the green **"Propose changes"** button. That's it! GitHub automatically handles all the technical steps for you.

This sends your suggestion to the project so it can be reviewed, discussed, and eventually merged into the Act.

## Style Guide

To keep the Act coherent as it grows, please keep the following in mind:

* **Tone:** The Act's voice is one of hope, determination, and respect. It is serious but accessible.
* **Clarity:** Write in clear, plain language wherever possible. The goal is for this document to be understood by all Canadians, not just legal experts.
* **Formatting:** Please maintain the existing Markdown formatting for headings, lists, and subsections (`Section 1`, `(1)`, `(a)`, `(i)`).

Thank you again for your interest in building a better future. We are excited to see what we can create together.
